description: SwiftUI app for collecting and analyzing hiking opinions using sentiment analysis.
language: Swift
framework: SwiftUI, NaturalLanguage
cursor:
  goals:
    - Build a polished survey app that evaluates and visualizes sentiment from user responses.
    - Use Appleâ€™s NaturalLanguage for local NLP (no external API).
    - Maintain clean MVVM or modular SwiftUI structure.
    - Optimize the UI for simplicity, readability, and performance.
  restrictions:
    - Do not use UIKit.
    - Avoid adding external sentiment APIs unless requested.
    - Keep data local (no backend).
  preferred_patterns:
    - Use `@StateObject` and `ObservableObject` to manage state.
    - Use enums for clean sentiment mapping.
    - Use `.task {}` or `.onAppear` to trigger async scoring.
  file_structure:
    - ContentView.swift (Main view)
    - Response.swift (Model)
    - ResponseView.swift (UI component)
    - Scorer.swift (Sentiment logic)
    - Sentiment.swift (Enum and icon mapping)
  testing:
    - Suggest adding unit tests for sentiment scoring.
    - Consider UI previews for different sentiment responses.
